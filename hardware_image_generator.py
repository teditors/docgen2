Hardware Image Generator

This module re-exports the HardwareImageGenerator class from the modular structure
to maintain backward compatibility with existing code that imports it.

# Re-export the main class from the new module structure
from hardware_generator_main import HardwareImageGenerator

# Keep other necessary imports for backward compatibility if needed
# If any constants or utility functions were used directly from the original file
